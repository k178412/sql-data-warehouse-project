## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Data Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).

![data architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184a426c-2f6e-46c3-a5d7-5de0cf1f2fa6)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data exactly as received from source systems.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleans and transforms data for consistency, applying standardization and normalization.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data, optimized for reporting and analytics.

---

## Project Overview
This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a structured data warehouse using Medallion Architecture.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data efficiently.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables for optimized analytics.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for useful insights.

## Project Files

1. **Datasets/**: Source CRM and ERP data stored as CSV files, used for ingestion into the warehouse.
2. **Docs/**: Draw.io diagrams illustrating data architecture, data flow, integration, data model, and ETL pipeline.
3. **Scripts/**: SQL scripts for database setup, table creation, ETL processes, and transformations.

## Diagrams

1. **Data Architecture**: Defines the structural flow of the data warehouse.
2. **Data Flow**: Defines how data moves through different layers.
3. **Data Integration**: Shows relationships between different sources.
4. **Data Model**: Represents logical schema for structured storage.
5. **ETL Pipeline**: Outlines the extraction, transformation, and loading process

## Tools Stack

1. **SQL Server**: Stores and processes structured data.
2. **Notion**: Tracks project progress and documentation.
3. **Draw.io**: Visualizes architecture, workflows, and system design.
4. **Git**: Manages version control and repository tracking.
