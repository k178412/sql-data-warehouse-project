## Data Architecture
This project follows Medallion Data Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).

![data architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184a426c-2f6e-46c3-a5d7-5de0cf1f2fa6)

1. **Bronze Layer**: It stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to clean and transform the data.
3. **Gold Layer**: It contains business-ready data optimized for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview
This project involves:

Data Architecture: Designing a modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the data warehouse.
Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for useful insights.

## Tools I Used

1. **SQL Server**: A powerful relational database management system for storing, querying, and managing structured data.
2. **Notion**: A flexible workspace for organizing project documentation, tracking progress, and collaborating.
3. **Draw.io**: A diagramming tool used to visually represent data architecture, workflows, and system designs.
4. **Git**: A platform for storing, managing, and tracking code changes using Git.
