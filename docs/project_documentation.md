# Data Warehouse Project Documentation

## Overview
This project builds a SQL-based Data Warehouse, structured using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers). 
It integrates CRM and ERP datasets, processes data using ETL pipelines, and prepares business-ready views for analytics and 
reporting.

## Data Architecture
This data warehouse follows a layered architecture for efficient data management and structured processing.
1. Bronze Layer â€“ Raw Data Storage
ðŸ”¹ Stores raw data directly from the source (CSV files from CRM and ERP systems).
ðŸ”¹ No transformations or filtering. Data is ingested as-is.
2. Silver Layer â€“ Processed Data Storage
ðŸ”¹ Cleans, standardizes, and normalizes data for accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Handles missing values, duplicates, derived attributes, and format corrections.
ðŸ”¹ Uses truncate & insert strategy to refresh data.
3. Gold Layer â€“ Business-Ready Data
ðŸ”¹ Creates structured views optimized for reporting, analytics, and queries.
ðŸ”¹ Implements Star Schema (Fact & Dimension tables) for efficient analysis.

## ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)
The ETL process moves data across layers while cleaning and structuring it.
1. Extract
ðŸ”¹ Loads CRM & ERP datasets from CSV files into Bronze Layer tables using Bulk Insert.
ðŸ”¹ Captures data without modifications.
2. Transform
ðŸ”¹ Cleans data by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
ðŸ”¹ Implements data transformation logics in SQL procedures.
ðŸ”¹ Moves data from Bronze â†’ Silver Layer using stored procedures.
3. Load
ðŸ”¹ Loads structured Silver Layer data into Gold Views, ready for analytics.
ðŸ”¹ Applies business rules, aggregations, and relationships (joins across datasets).

## Data Model (Fact & Dimension Tables)
This warehouse follows a Star Schema, where:
1. Dimension Tables (Descriptive Data)
ðŸ”¹ Customers â†’ Stores customer profiles from CRM & ERP systems.
ðŸ”¹ Products â†’ Holds product details with category mapping.
3. Fact Table (Transactional Data)
ðŸ”¹ Sales Transactions â†’ Records purchases, prices, quantities, and sales dates.
Relationships are defined using customer IDs, product keys, and order numbers to enable fast querying.

## Analytics & Reporting
The Gold Layer views help generate:
ðŸ”¹ Customer insights (demographics, purchase behavior, location-based analysis).
ðŸ”¹ Sales trends (monthly revenue, product performance, order frequency).
ðŸ”¹ Inventory tracking (product availability, demand forecasting).
Users can query these views using SQL, integrate data with BI tools, or connect them to dashboards.
